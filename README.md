##A new grand mean paleomagnetic pole for the 1.11 Ga Umkondo Large Igneous Province with implications for paleogeography and the geomagnetic field.

This repository contains materials associated with a manuscript focused on the paleomagnetism of the Umkondo Large Igneous Province that was published in Geophysical Journal International.

Within this Github repository are the following folders:

###Code
This folder contains two Jupyter/IPython notebook files that contain the data analysis used for the paper. The folder also contains non-standard function modules containing paleomagnetism focused functions which are necessary to run the code within the notebook.

To run the code in the notebook it is necessary to both download the code from the Github repository and have an installed Python distribution that includes IPython and the other standard scientific python libraries (http://www.scipy.org/). There are good instructions for installing IPython/Jupyter here: http://ipython.org/install.html. Alternatively you can view the notebooks online with the Jupyter nbviewer at these links:

* The published data compilation notebook. This notebook contains the details of the compilation including the combination of previously published "sites" into single cooling unit sites: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Swanson-Hysell-Group/2015_Umkondo_Pole/blob/master/Code/Umkondo_Published_Data_Compilation.ipynb
* The new data and associated analysis notebook. This notebook includes analysis of the newly developed data, combination of that data with previously published results and the code associated with the calculation of the mean pole and paleosecular variation parameters: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Swanson-Hysell-Group/2015_Umkondo_Pole/blob/master/Code/Umkondo_New_Data.ipynb

###Data
This folder contains the data from this study and that from previous work that are imported into the Jupyter/IPython notebooks and utilized in the analysis.

###GPlates
This folder contains reconstruction files put together using the GPlates software package (http://www.gplates.org) along with videos of the two reconstruction interpretations that are described in the manuscript (Figure 4). These videos can't be viewed on Github, but are hosted and availible for viewing here: http://www.swanson-hysell.org/research/umkondo-lip/

###Manuscript
This folder contains the text of the paper and the figure files. The LaTEX source is included as are the output PDF files. These PDF files can be viewed within Github using the first link or downloaded using the second link:
