\section{Introduction}

This Supplementary Information is output from two Jupyter notebooks that can be viewed online at the links provided below or accessed in the Github repository associated with the paper: \url{https://github.com/Swanson-Hysell-Group/2015_Umkondo}. The two notebooks compiled here include a published data compilation notebook and a new data and associated analysis notebook. The published data compilation notebook contains the details of the compilation including the combination of previously published "sites" into single cooling unit sites: \url{http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Swanson-Hysell-Group/2015_Umkondo/blob/master/Code/Umkondo_Published_Data_Compilation.ipynb}. The new data and associated analysis notebook includes analysis of the newly developed data, combination of that data with previously published results and the code associated with the calculation of the mean pole and paleosecular variation parameters: \url{http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Swanson-Hysell-Group/2015_Umkondo/blob/master/Code/Umkondo_New_Data.ipynb}. Some of the tables which are truncated below, can be viewed in full when the notebooks are rendered in a web browser.

In addition to the notebooks, all of the data that are imported into them for the analysis are available within the Github repository.

  
    \section{Synthesis of prior paleomagnetic results from the Umkondo Large
Igneous
Province}\label{synthesis-of-prior-paleomagnetic-results-from-the-umkondo-large-igneous-province}

    Prior paleomagnetic results from the Umkondo Large Igneous Province were
analyzed using the reasoning and code detailed below.

    \subsection{Approach to dealing with previously published
data}\label{approach-to-dealing-with-previously-published-data}

    There are multiple groups of data being integrated into our analysis: -
Group 1. Site mean data from Gose et al. (2006) wherein the measurement
level data were fully documented in the theses of Pancake (2001) and
Seidel (2004). - Group 2. Site mean data published by Jones and
McElhinny (1996), McElhinny and Opdyke (1964), and McElhinny (1966) and
compiled by Gose et al. (2006) wherein the sample level data are not
available. There are additional similar data in the Gose et al. (2006)
that we do not include for reasons stated below. Results not included in
Gose et al. (2006), found in Mare et al. (2006) and Wilson et al. (1987)
are also included in the analysis. - Group 3. New data from Umkondo
sills of Botswana from this study.

The definition of a site in Pancake (2001), Seidel (2004) and Gose et
al. (2006) was a single geographic locality within a single igneous
unit. In Gose et al. (2006), these sites were given equal weight in
calculating 10 regional mean directions. A Fisher mean was then
calculated from these regional mean directions for the overall Umkondo
mean. As discussed in the main text, we consider the best practice in
the calculation of a paleomagnetic pole to be taking the Fisher mean of
virtual geomagnetic poles (VGPs) whereby each VGP is an individual
cooling unit that is interpretted to record a single snapshot of the
geomagnetic field. Within the Gose et al. (2006) analysis, there are
cases where multiple sites are from within the same sill, but where each
site is still given equal weight in calculating the regional mean with
the regional means then being given equal weight in calculating an
overall mean.

The first step in this analysis was to redo all of the principal
component analysis of the Pancake (2001) and Seidel (2004) data in order
to have the Group 1 data at the specimen level. Having the data at the
specimen level allows for new means to be calculated for cooling units
that had been sampled at multiple ``sites'' by these workers. Using
geological maps along with our field data, we have gone through
previously studied sites and assessed, to the best of our ability,
whether multiple ``sites'' are from the same cooling unit (the
definition of site used by the Magnetics Information Consortium is a
unique geological unit representing an instance in time). This approach
enables us to transform the data given in Pancake (2001), Seidel (2004),
and Gose et al. (2006) to VGPs.

In terms of the Group 2 data sets, we use data from these studies when
they meet the following conditions: (1) number of samples is greater
than 3 (n\textgreater{}3) and (2) they can be determined to be from a
single cooling unit distinct from a cooling unit where data were
obtained by Pancake (2001), Seidel (2004) or our study. Here are details
related to each one of these studies that fall into Group 2:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Jones and McElhinny (1966)--- Dolerite sills from Botswana and South
  Africa. Sites from this study are include when we can determine that
  they are distinct cooling units.

  \begin{itemize}
  
  \item
    Sites 1 and 2 are from the Shoshong Sill (sensu stricto) which was
    also analyzed by Pancake (2001) and in our study. Therefore, we will
    not use the Jones and McElhinny (1966) data for this sill.
  \item
    Sites 3, 4 and 5 are from the same sill. All sites have excellent
    statistics and very similar directions. Site 3 has the lowest
    \(\alpha_{95}\) (2.0º) and most samples (n=8) and is the VGP we will
    use for the grand mean.
  \item
    Site 6 is from the same sill as JP22/JP23/JP24/JP25 and will
    therefore not be used for the new grand mean.
  \item
    Site 7 is from a unique sill in the Botswana North area.
  \item
    Site 8 is from a sill we refer to as the Lentsweletau Sill. The same
    sill was sampled by Swanson-Hysell and Hanson as site PW20, without
    yielding coherent results. Therefore, this Jones and McElhinny sill
    is included in the compilation.
  \item
    Site 9 is from the Kgale Peak sill which was analyzed in Pancake
    (2001) and in this study. Therefore, the Jones and McElhinny (1966)
    data will not be used for this sill.
  \item
    Site A1 is from a Paleoproterozoic Moshaneng sill.
  \item
    Site 10 is from a unique Waterberg sill.
  \item
    Site 11 is the same sill as sampled by Seidel (2004) at the W-01 and
    W-02 sites and is therefore not included in our compilation.
  \item
    Site 12 is the same sill as sampled by Seidel (2004) at the VF4 and
    VF5 sites. These data were similar in direction (and north-seeking
    polarity) to the VF4 and VF5 sites of Seidel, but the data from site
    12 was much more tightly grouped and are preferentially included
    over the Seidel results. This sill was dated to be 1108.5 $\pm$ 0.8
    Ma (207Pb/206Pb baddeleyite date; Hanson et al., 2004).
  \item
    Site 13 is from an Umkondo sill cross-cutting the Premier Kimberlite
    located to the west of the Waterberg outcrops in the Middleburg
    basin. The site was collected underground and is not related to any
    of the intrusions sampled by Seidel (2004).

  McDonald and Anderson (1973)--- Dolerite sills from the Vredefort Dome
  area (unpublished data from an honors thesis). None of these data have
  the number of samples (n) reported and are not included in our
  compilation.
\item
  McElhinny (1966)--- All of these sites from the Umkondo Lavas have
  n\textless{}=3 except for site 4 which is identical to site J of
  McElhinny and Opdyke (1964; same location and direction) as stated in
  the 1966 paper:

  \begin{quote}
  ``Site 4, in the Jersey basalts, was previously sampled by McElhinny
  \& Opdyke (1964) as Umkondo dolerite and thought to be a very fine
  grained variety. At the time of sampling, geological mapping in the
  area was still in progress. Mapping further south the following field
  season by Watson (1964) established that these were in fact the
  northerly extension of the Zamchiya basalts. The connection between
  the two was traced across the MoCambique border and back into Southern
  Rhodesia. The Zamchiya basalts often contain amygdales, whereas the
  Jersey basalts are the non-amygdaloidal variety. Site 4 is therefore
  that reported as site J by McElhinny \& Opdyke (1964)and the
  measurements made on seven 6 in. cores at this locality are reported
  here again (see Table 1).''

\item
  McElhinny and Opdyke (1964)--- Dolerites (and basalts) from Zimbabwe.
  Based on analysis of their locations with reference to mapping by
  Tyndale-Biscoe (1958), Watson (1969) and Stocklmayer (1978), we
  consider sites A, B, and C to come from a single cooling unit. Sites D
  through G each come from separate cooling units, and sites H and I
  come from still another cooling unit. Given that site B has an
  \(\alpha_{95}\) of 4.5º and sites A and C had \(\alpha_{95}\) values
  of 9.0º and 12.5º, respectively, we choose to use the mean from site B
  as representative of the sill's direction (without the availibility of
  sample level data it is difficult to combine these data into a single
  site level mean). The same selection process is used for sites H and
  I, where H is preffered because of its higher precision.
\item
  Mare et al. (2006)--- Dolerite sills sampled in two regions within the
  Nylstroom protobasin and the Middelburg basin.

  \begin{itemize}
  
  \item
    One sill was sampled 6 times in the Nylstroom area with no overlap
    with any other previously published data (SHD- sample suite).
    However, the site mean results are very scattered and inconsistent
    with very few samples used to calculate a final mean. Therefore we
    will not include Nylstroom (Swaershoek Fm. dolerite) data in the
    compilation.
  \item
    8 sites were sampled in the Middelburg area with four of those sites
    overlapping with data generated from sills in Seidel (2004). Of
    those four, two sites have slightly inconsistent results with very
    large error intervals (WRD6 and WRD7). Two others sites (WRD4 and
    WRD5) are also from unique cooling units and have much lower error
    intervals.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Wilson et al. (1987)--- Two dolerite dikes sampled in northern
  Zimbabwe to the WNW of sites sampled by McElhinny and Opdyke (1964).

  \begin{itemize}
  
  \item
    One dike (Wil\_1) intrudes a very prominent NNE-trending set of
    faults (Popoteke), east of Harare, and yielded an Umkondo
    magnetization.
  \item
    Another dike (Wil\_2) named the Deweras dike, trends roughly
    northeast and was sampled at its southern end, yielding a
    north-seeking Umkondo-like magentization.

    \subsection{Data from Seidel (2004)}\label{data-from-seidel-2004}

    The W-series sites of Gose et al. (2006) are dolerite sills that
intruded the Waterburg Group and are exposed near Middleburg, South
Africa. The raw measurement level paleomagnetic data for the W-series
specimens are reported in the Master's thesis of Seidel (2004). We
digitized all of these data, converted them into MagIC format, and
conducted least-squares analysis in order to have directions at the
sample level. Having directions at the sample level allows us to
calculate means by cooling unit rather than relying on existing site
means. The data with all of the fits are imported into a dataframe and
displayed as a table. The tilt-corrections used by Seidel (2004) were
applied to the data.

    \subsubsection{W-series sites of Seidel
(2004)}\label{w-series-sites-of-seidel-2004}

    Geological mapping in the the Middleburg area of South Africa summarized
in the simplified map below from Seidel (2004) suggests that these
groupings of sites each represent an individual sill: 1. W-01 and W-02
2. W-03, W-06, and W-07 3. W-04 4. W-05 5. W-08 and W-09 6. W-10

We will calculate cooling unit means and virtual geomagnetic poles for
each one of these sills. The sites L-1, L-2 and WS-1 are
Paleoproterozoic sedimentary rocks that were sampled by Seidel. Two of
these sites (L-1 and WS-1) have Umkondo overprints and were included in
the overall mean by Gose et al. (2006), but will not be included here as
they are not Umkondo cooling units.

    \paragraph{W01 and W02 Middleburg
sill}\label{w01-and-w02-middleburg-sill}

    Seidel writes that these two sites within this individual sill are
petrographically similar. \textgreater{} ``\ldots{}typical dolerite
texture, with both enstatite and clinopyroxene present. There is
relatively abundant interstitial microgranophyre ('''15\%), and some of
the subophitic enstatite shows blebby exsolution." (Seidel, 2004)

    The dataframe of all Seidel (2004) fits can be split by site.

    Some of these data appear to be outliers from the main population. These
outliers could be a result of lightning remagnetization or rotated
blocks and we take the approach that they should not be included in the
calculated mean for the sill. Values that are farther away than
3*\(\alpha_{95}\) from the initial mean are excluded from the calculated
mean in the code below. A new mean is then calculated.

    \paragraph{W-03, W-06, and W-07 Middleburg
sill}\label{w-03-w-06-and-w-07-middleburg-sill}

    Site W-03 has a different mean direction than is typical for Umkondo
intrusions. Based on this difference, Gose et al. (2006) interpret the
sill as being Paleoproterozoic and corresponding to other intrusions
pre-dating the Umkondo event that have been grouped into a
Waterberg-Soutpansberg Dolorite (WSD) pole. Interestingly, a few samples
yielded an Umkondo-like direction, possibly an overprint. However, it
should also be noted that there was concern when this site was sampled
that the dolerite blocks being sampled might not be in place:

\begin{quote}
W-03: Twelve samples were drilled from four blocks embedded in the
ground in a level area on the south-facing side of a hill at Fort
Merensky. Bedding in the host Waterberg strata above the sampled sill
dips 10° to 029°. Although the blocks chosen for sampling were quite
large, there was considerable concern that some were not in place. Many
of the blocks showed evidence of tilting, possibly due to creep. In
addition, there was ample evidence that even some of the larger blocks
had been moved during construction of the fort. The paleomagnetic
analysis indicated that one of the blocks had indeed been moved relative
to the others. However, the scatter in the remaining data points
(Appendix I) could not be attributed to relative movement of the blocks.
(Seidel, 2004)
\end{quote}

Sites W-06 and W-07 are from the same intrusion as W-03, and at site
W-07 a baked-contact test was performed (WS-1) with inconclusive
results. Site W-07 has very scattered demagnetization data not amenable
to least-squares fits. W-06 is quite scattered also, but with a few
sample yielding directions similiar to those typical for the Umkondo
province. Perhaps an Umkondo overprint affected some of the samples from
this intrusion. However, another possibility for the variation is that
the sample blocks are not demonstrably \emph{in situ}:

\begin{quote}
Twelve samples were drilled from two separate dolerite blocks believed
to be in situ. (Seidel, 2004)
\end{quote}

Given the Paleoproterozoic age interpretation for the sill, these data
are not included in the new Umkondo compilation.

    In addition to the steep lower hemisphere direction of the W03 site
interpreted by Gose et al. (2006) to be a primary Paleoproterozoic
remanence, both the W03 and W06 sites within this intrusion have samples
with southerly and shallowly inclined directions that may indicate an
Umkondo overprint. However, this intrusion is excluded from the Umkondo
group given the Paleoproterozoic interpretation for its age.

    W03 appears to have a more consistent mean than W06. We cut out a few
scattered data points and include the W03 edited mean in the table of
``unknown'' directions from older/younger intrusions.

    \paragraph{W04 sill}\label{w04-sill}

    \begin{quote}
W-04: Twelve samples in four clusters were drilled along the banks of
the Klein Olifants River, where the river cuts through the dolerite,
exposing fresh, in situ blocks (Figure 21). These samples were taken
inside the city limits of Middleburg just off Protea Road. Waterberg
strata dip 6°to 042 downstream of the drill site. No enstatite is
present in the sampled dolerite, and interstitial microgranophyre is
relatively common. (Seidel, 2004)

    Seidel sampled both the sill (as site W05) and collected samples from
host sedimentary rock (site L-1). Gose et al. (2006) included the sill
and the overprinted sediment as separate sites each contributing to the
overall Umkondo mean. We will include the sill, but not the host rock.

    The W08 directions are red while the W09 directions are blue. There is
tight correspondance between the data from these two sites which makes
sense given that they were collected from the same sill. There appears
to be a single point within the W09 directions that is an outlier. Let's
remove this point and calculate a mean for the sill that combines the
directions from both sites. A test for a common mean is also included
below.

Results of Watson V test: 

Watson's V:           6.5
Critical value of V:  6.6
"Pass": Since V is less than Vcrit, the null hypothesis
that the two populations are drawn from distributions
that share a common mean direction can not be rejected.

M\&M1990 classification:

Angle between data set means: 5.8
Critical angle for M\&M1990:   5.9
The McFadden and McElhinny (1990) classification for
this test is: 'B'

    \paragraph{W-10 sill}\label{w-10-sill}

    Site W-10 does not yield consistent directions. Some of the samples are
near an Umkondo direction, but there is not enough consistency between
the directions for a mean direction to be calculated with confidence.
This sill was not included in the Gose et al. (2006) compilation and
will not be used for mean calculations in this study. Part of the reason
for this scatter could be explained by this information provided by
Seidel (2004): \textgreater{} W-10: Twelve samples were drilled from
four in situ dolerite blocks in a large open field. The low outcrops
were visible because of a recent fire.

    \subsubsection{VF-series sites of Seidel
(2004)}\label{vf-series-sites-of-seidel-2004}

    Based on the geological maps of the Vredefort area (South Africa), we
consider these groupings of sites to each represent an individual sill:
1. VF-1 and VF2 2. VF-3 3. VF-4 and VF5

We calculate cooling unit means and virtual geomagnetic poles for each
one of these sills. Only one of these sites (VF-1) was used by Gose et
al. (2006) for pole calculations. Combining data, especially in the case
of VF-4 and VF-5, yields a better mean.

    \paragraph{VF-1 and VF-2 intrusion}\label{vf-1-and-vf-2-intrusion}

    Site VF-1 is the most stable and consistent paleomagnetic site in the
VF-series. About half the samples from site VF-2 are consistent with
results from VF-1. There was concern at the time of sampling whether the
sampled blocks were all \emph{in situ}: \textgreater{}``VF-2: Eleven
samples were drilled in three sets from a large outcrop of
medium-grained dolerite similar to that at site VF-1. Even though the
pieces drilled were relatively large, there was concern that some had
experienced rotation either from falling or creep.'' (Seidel, 2004) A
date of 1108.6 $\pm$ 1.2 Ma 207Pb/206Pb
on baddeleyite) for the VF-2 intrusion (referred to as the Anna's Rust
Gabbro) was published in Hanson et al. (2004).

    \paragraph{VF-3}\label{vf-3}

    No other sites were sampled in the same intrusion as VF-3. This
intrusion was excluded from the calculations of Gose et al. (2006) as a
result of the paleomagnetic results being scattered as can be seen in
the equal area plot below. The intrusion is reported to be slightly
altered by Seidel (see below), including olivine grains that yielded
fine-grained magnetite as an alteration product. Given the lack of
consistency between the sample directions, this site will not be
included in the grand mean calculated here.

    \begin{quote}
The pyroxene is lightly altered to actinolite and smectite, and the
plagioclase is lightly sericitized. Anhedral olivine
(\textasciitilde{}10\%) is surrounded by pyroxene reaction rims. No
interstitial microgranophyre is present. The olivine is partly altered
to bastite and very fine-grained magnetite. (Seidel, 2004)

    The Jones and McElhinny site mean from this same sill (12) is much more
tightly constrained and we include it in the compilation rather than the
VF4\_VF5 data. We would combine all the results to create one mean, but
we do not have the sample level data from Jones and McElhinny. Because
the VF4 and VF5 data are more scattered than, but consistent with, `site
12' from Jones and McElhinny, we choose to use the Jones and McElhinny
results (they are added to the compilation later in this analysis).

    \subsubsection{Timbavati Intrusion (TG-series) of Seidel
(2004)}\label{timbavati-intrusion-tg-series-of-seidel-2004}

    The Timbavati Gabbro is an intrusive body that extends for over 300 km
near the border of Mozambique. The southern portion of the sill near
TG-03 reaches thicknesses of over 400 m, and near site TG-05 has a
thickness of \textasciitilde{}200 m (Walraven, 1986). The data
compilation of Gose et al. (2006) calculated means for geographically
distinct sites within the Timbavati Gabbro and then calculated a mean of
these sites to use as one of the area means that was assigned unit
vector weight in the overall mean Umkondo pole.

In contrast to the dolerite sills discussed thus far, determining what
constitutes an individual cooling unit within the Timbavati Gabbro is
difficult. Geochemical data developed by Bullen (2005) identified
distinct geochemical groups within individual mapped sills indicating
that the bodies are composite intrusions formed by multiple pulses of
magma. Distinct petrology of olivine gabbro, gabbro and quartz gabbro
are present, but have been interpretted to be interlayered and
consanguineous (Walraven, 1986; Hargraves et al., 1994). Delineating
distinct cooling units is therefore difficult. If the approach is taken
to consider the gabbro as a single body, a sheet-like intrusion with a
thickness of 200 m (applicable to a half-space cooling model, see
Delaney (1987)), that intrudes at approximately 1150\(^\circ\)C into a
host rock of 50\(^\circ\)C could take \textasciitilde{}800 yrs to cool
below 500\(^\circ\)C at its center. The margin of the intrusion would
have cooled significantly faster than the center of the intrusion. It is
unclear how the different TG-series sites are distributed with respect
to the margins, but many appear to be from coarse-grained regions. Even
with all sites having been taken from the interior, the timescale of
cooling is not long enough to fully average out secular variation.

One division that does seem clear is that the data from Bullen (2005)
revealed a unique geochemical signature throughout the northernmost
exposure (corresponding to sites TG-08 and TG-09) suggesting that it is
distinct from the intrusive rocks to the south. Divisions between the
rest of the sites are difficult. We tentatively take the approach of
considering the rest of the sites as being from a single large cooling
unit and group sites TG-01, TG-02, TG-03, TG-04, TG-05, TG-06, TG-07,
TG-11 and TG-12 as being from the same thick sill. This approach is a
crude approximation that could be refined through subsequent work.

    TG01 is a baked-contact test for a Karoo dike (the tight grouping of
vectors near {[}330,-80{]}) into an Umkondo Sill, so half the samples
are the baked Karoo direction. The baked-contact test (BCT) results
represent a positive inverse baked-contact test, confirming that the
magnetization from the Timbavati gabbro is older then the Karoo LIP in
age. An additional note on the BCT: the original authors suggest that
the baked zone is asymmetrical, but cover on the margins of the dike
allow enough wiggle room for the baked zones to still be symmetrical in
width.

TG03 samples (dark green) and TG04 are both quite scattered. The rest of
the sites appear to have at least some samples that yield Umkondo-like
directions.

    \subsection{Data from Pancake (2001)}\label{data-from-pancake-2001}

    We evaluate data from the Pancake (2001) thesis in the same way we dealt
with sites from the Seidel (2004) thesis. Maps are used to see which
sites are sampled from the same intrusion, then we will see which of
these sites have paleomagnetic results that could be combined. Sampling
was conducted in southeast Botswana in two different regions.

    The raw demagnetization data from the Pancake (2001) thesis were
digitized, converted to MagIC format, and then fit with vectors in order
to combine sites from the same intrusions. Below is the sample
magnetization data table for all of the sites/samples yielding stable
data.

    The directions from sites JP2 and JP3 account for most of the scatter,
so we will only calculate a mean direction to JP1, which appears to be
very different dec/inc given in Gose et al. (2006) for JP1 (Dec: 0.0,
Inc: -0.1, a95: 21.6). Pancake (2001) describes types of magnetite
grains in the rock, possibly associated with high temperature
alteration:

    \begin{quote}
Hornblende and biotite occur as discrete grains of late-stage magmatic
or high temperature deuteric origin. Magnetite occurs as discrete larger
primary grains and as fine-grained or symplectic intergrowths with
biotite, which are inferred to be of deuteric origin. Deuteric
mineralization has resulted in formation of chlorite and epidote along
joint surfaces and as alteration products of the primary phases (Eales,
1959). - (Pancake, 2001)

    Jones and McElhinny (1966) determined this sill to have the opposite
polarity (south-pointing declination). Our new data (sites PW1 and PW2)
also found south-seeking magnetizations. These results are puzzling when
compared to the north-seeking results from JP1. Perhaps the results from
JP(1-3) are not primary. Given the consistency between the Jones and
McElhinny (1966) south-seeking polarity and the south-seeking polarity
in the new data generated in this study for PW1 and PW2, we consider the
south-seeking polarity to be primary and use data from our new sampling
locales for the grand mean and polarity summary.

    \subsubsection{Manyana Sill (SW Kgale)}\label{manyana-sill-sw-kgale}

    Three sites were sampled in the Manyana sill, which is just east of the
eponymous town. A new site was sampled here in 2012 (NSH/RH), PW3. All
of the sites studied by Pancake (2001) yielded very scattered
demagnetization data, and some samples published in the Pancake thesis
were not completely demagnetized\ldots{}perhaps everything was finished
for Gose et al. (2006)? Regardless, the data are not of use. The newly
studied samples from the Manyana Sill, PW3, yielded data that can be
used for this cooling unit. This new site was selected to try and avoid
lightning struck areas.

Pegmatitic dolerite occurs as discontinuous, subhorizontal layers,
subvertical veins, and irregular pockets up to 40 cm across at this
locality. Six cores were collected from a large exfoliation surface in
typical dolerite at the very base of the outcrop, within the middle part
of the sill\ldots{}The granite here was partially melted during dolerite
emplacement, implying that a significant volume of magma may have been
transported laterally in the sill to provide the necessary heat for
melting. (Pancake, 2001)
\end{quote}

    \subsubsection{Moshaneng and Kanye
Sills}\label{moshaneng-and-kanye-sills}

    One site was sampled in one sill near the town of Moshaneng, and two
sites were sampled in the sill near the town Kanye. In addition, Jones
and McElhinny (1966) sampled one site in each sill (J\_M\_A1 in
Moshaneng and J\_M\_A2 in Kanye).

    Site JP8 yields mostly scattered magnetization directions with only
pairs of samples sharing similar directions. JP9 and JP11 each yield
stable data. Only six samples are shown for site JP9 in the Pancake
thesis. An additional eight samples from that site were collected by
Hanson in 2002, after the Pancake thesis was completed, and were used to
calculate the mean direction for the site given in Gose et al. (2006).
The mean direction given by Jones and McElhinny (1966) for their site A1
is consistent with results from JP9 as expected given that the data are
for the same intrusion.

The sill near Moshaneng has multiple magmatic ages at ca. 1927 Ma but
also yields an K-Ar age of \textasciitilde{}1110 ±44 Ma (Gose et al.,
2006). There is a concise discussion of these sites in Gose et al.
(2006):

\begin{quote}
\ldots{}three separate samples from different parts of the Moshaneng
Dolerite have yielded U-Pb baddeleyite ages of 1927.7 ± 0.5 to 1927.1 ±
0.7 Ma {[}Hanson et al., 2004b{]}. Two sites (JP9 and JP10) yielded
magnetization directions markedly different from the directions for the
Umkondo intrusions in the region (Figure 5) {[}Hanson et al., 2004b{]}.
A third site in the Moshaneng Dolerite (JP11), which has yielded a U-Pb
baddeleyite age of 1927.3 ± 0.7 Ma, has a well-clustered magnetization
direction statistically identical to directions for other dolerites in
southeastern Botswana assigned to the Umkondo province (Table 1). It is
likely that the dolerite at site JP11 was remagnetized during the
Umkondo event, although no Umkondo intrusions are exposed in the
vicinity. Jones and McElhinny {[}1966{]} reported a K-Ar date of 1110 ±
44 Ma (recalculated to currently recommended constants) for a
plagioclase-pyroxene fraction from a sample of the Moshaneng Dolerite
collected near our sites JP9 and JP10, which suggests that these older
dolerites were thermally disturbed during the Umkondo event.
\end{quote}

Even though we discuss the results below, for the above reasons we
exclude data from JP9 and JP11 from the Umkondo mean.

JP9 and JP11 each produce a VGP unless there is evidence that the sills
are actually the same. This is unlikely because the directions are of
opposite polarity. However, we have decided not to include results from
the Moshaneng sill (JP9 and JP11) because U-Pb baddeleyite ages from the
sill yielded an ages of ca. 1927 Ma (Hanson et al., 2004 \emph{S. Afr.
J. Geol.}).

The sills are poorly exposed but appear to be concordant with the
Transvaal strata. The age of these sills is unknown, and they could be
significantly older than the Moshaneng dolerite. The dolerite at this
site is distinctly different from other sills observed in the area
because it contains abundant, large ophitic pyroxene crystals. (Pancake,
2001)

    6 different localities were sampled in the area north of Molepolole by
Pancake as can be seen in the map below. Jones and McElhinny (1966) also
sampled at two localities in the area (site IDs: N1 and 8, found on

    Some observations on the intrusion(s) as a whole: \textgreater{} The
dolerite is shown on the geologic map as one large, continuous unit that
intrudes Waterberg sedimentary units (Jones, 1973). The area is
dissected by numerous faults. Field observations by the author indicate
that a number of thick sills occur in this area but, because of
generally poor exposure, it is impossible to determine the exact number
of sills present or their dimensions. (Pancake, 2001)

Six sites were sampled by Pancake:

JP15: \textgreater{} Sample JP15 was collected from pavement exposure in
an abandoned barrow pit. Field observations indicate that the site is
located in the upper part of a sill, close to its contact with overlying
Waterberg sandstone. The dolerite at this site is typically medium
grained with common ophitic augite up to 1 cm across (Fig. 15).
Plagioclase is generally altered to sericite and epidote, and pyroxene
shows some uralitization. Ten cores were drilled in a small (\textless{}
3 m\^{}2) weathered pavement exposure in the barrow pit. The site is
unique in this study because the dolerite is not highly magnetized.
(Pancake, 2001)

JP16: \textgreater{} The dolerite shows strong deuteric alteration.
Plagioclase is largely replaced by epidote and sericite, and pyroxene is
partly to completely replaced by chlorite and uralite. Ten cores were
collected \textasciitilde{} 4 m from the upper margin of the sill, from
four large, adjacent masses that appear to be in place but may have
experienced some rotation during weathering and erosion. (Pancake, 2001)

JP18/JP19: \textgreater{} JP18 and 19 were collected from a single
dolerite sill\ldots{}The sill has experienced deuteric alteration, which
is represented by replacement of plagioclase by sericite, and alteration
of pyroxene to smectite and chlorite\ldots{}.{[}near JP19{]} has
undergone significant deuteric alteration similar to that at site JP18
(Pancake, 2001)

JP20: \textgreater{} The dolerite is uniformly fine grained and shows
strong deuteric alteration. (Pancake, 2001)

JP21: \textgreater{} The dolerite here displays strong deuteric
alteration\ldots{}Cores 1-5 were collected from \emph{in situ} pavement
exposure 100 m south of cores 6-10. Cores 6-10 were drilled in several
dolerite masses that could possibly have experienced some rotation.

Data from all sites are plotted below.

    Only three of the sites shown have consistent/stable paleomagnetic
results, therefore we will exclude the other three sites that have
incoherent behavior (JP18, JP20, and JP21). This leaves JP15, JP16 and
JP19 for consideration

Given their proximity and similar elevation, JP15 and JP16 appear to be
from the same sill, which we refer to as the Suping Sill. Two of the new
sites sampled by Swanson-Hysell and Hanson (PW11 and PW12) were quite
close to JP15. At present, we consider JP19 to be from a distinct sill
that we refer to as the Mabelwane Hill Sill given its distance from
sites in the Suping Sill (15 km), the lack of continuity in outcrop
expression and the distinct level it should represent based on the
observed dip of the Suping Sill.

    \subsubsection{Mosolotsane 1 Intrusion}\label{mosolotsane-1-intrusion}

    Near the town of Mosolotsane, Pancake (2001) sampled for paleomagnetism
from three localities: JP22, JP23 and JP24 (see map above).

\begin{quote}
Samples JP22-24\ldots{}are inferred to come from a single
north-trending, gently west-dipping sill, based on topographic relations
between the separate exposures. The sill\ldots{}is unusually felsic
rich\ldots{}.\textbf{In general the samples are not highly altered}.
(Pancake, 2001)

    \paragraph{Mosolotsane 1 date}\label{mosolotsane-1-date}

    Two samples were collected for geochronology: JP24 and JP25 and
207Pb/206Pb weighted mean dates on baddeleyite were published in Hanson
et al. (2004):

\begin{itemize}

\item
  JP24: 1109.3 ±0.8 Ma
\item
  JP25: 1109.3 ±1.0 Ma
\end{itemize}

These two geochronologic samples are from the same sill (note the
similarity of the dates) and so a single weighted mean should be
calculated from the individual baddeyite grain dates published in Hanson
et al. (2004). This recalculation is done in the code below:

    \subsubsection{Shoshong Sill}\label{shoshong-sill}

    Sites JP26, JP31, JP33 and JP34 were collected from the thick Shoshong
Sill. This sill was also sampled by Jones and McElhinny (1966) as sites
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and by Swanson-Hysell and Hanson as site PW28. A
description is provided by Pancake (2001):

\begin{quote}
JP26 and 31-34 were collected from the areally extensive, thick
(\textgreater{}120 m in places) dolerite sill that caps the Shoshong
Hills\ldots{}According to Grubb (1961), several vertical petrographic
zones occur in the sill. The lower two zones, which make up over half of
the sill, are bronzite-phyric dolerite. These two zones are separated by
an interval of rhythmic layering defined by orthopyroxene-rich layers
several centimeters thick (Fig. 13). The third zone lacks orthopyroxene
and contains weakly subophitic augite and pigeonite. The upper 11 m of
the sill is characterized by abundant pegmatitic segregations.
\end{quote}

    \paragraph{Shoshong dates}\label{shoshong-dates}

    Samples JP32a and JP35 were both collected from the large Shosong sill.
Information about JP32a is provided in Pancake (2001):

\begin{quote}
Sample JP32a was collected from the southern part of the large Shoshong
sill northwest of the village of Shoshong (Fig. 25). This sample is
\textasciitilde{} 100 m west of paleomagnetic sample site JP31 and is
separated from that site by a small, northeast-trending valley. The rock
at site JP32a is significantly more felsic than that at the
paleomagnetic sample site. It is inferred to occupy a down-faulted block
derived from the felsic, pegmatite-rich, upper part of the sill
described by Grubb (1961). The fault separating the two sites appears to
lie within the valley running between them. This fault is not shown by
Skinner (1978a), although he does show another fault subparallel to it
and a short distance east of site JP31 (Fig. 25). The felsic-rich rock
at site JP32a is medium-grained, clinopyroxene-rich granite with
abundant interstitial granophyre and is typical of the more
differentiated portions of the sills in the northern part of the study
area. Coarser grained, discontinuous pegmatitic segregations several
centimeters across show gradational contacts with the host rock. The
geochronological sample comes from part of the granite that contains
abundant pegmatitic segregations.
\end{quote}

Dates for samples JP32A and JP35 were presented separately in Hanson et
al., (2004) with very similar weighted mean dates. In the code below, we
calculate a combined weighted mean for the samples combined given that
each of the geochronology samples come from the same cooling unit.

    \subsection{Data from Jones and McElhinny
(1966)}\label{data-from-jones-and-mcelhinny-1966}

    In the introduction to this notebook, the rationale for what sites from
Jones and McElhinny (1966) will be integrated into this compilation is
explained. These sites are: 3, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13.

The data for these sites are from Table 2 of Jones and McElhinny (1966).
Tilt-corrections for these sites were variably applied using the
orientation of the overlying sediments as explained in this quotation:

\begin{quote}
In the vicinity of site 10, the Waterberg red beds that have been
intruded by the dolerite sill, dip at 24º toward the north (5º east of
north). In this region the similar folding of the overlying Karroo
sediments proves that the age of the folding was post-Karroo. The data
presented in Table 2 and Figures 2 and 3 relating to this site have
therefore been corrected for the attitude of the adjacent sediments. At
the other sites, the intruded beds were either fiat lying or dipped at
not more than 10º in the east-west direction. Since the directions of
magnetization are nearly horizontal in a north-south direction, the
correction for the attitude of the adjacent sediments makes no
significant difference to the directions of magnetizations. Sites 1 to
13 include all the post-Waterberg diabases from which results were
obtained and some diabases which have been classified as post-Transvaal
or post-Ventersdorp.

    \subsection{Data from McElhinny and Opdyke
(1964)}\label{data-from-mcelhinny-and-opdyke-1964}

    Next we add data from other individual cooling units calculated by
McElhinny and Opdyke (1964). All of the sites studied are distinct
cooling units except for sites B and C, which are from the same cooling
unit. We exclude site C because it has lower precision than B.

Tilt-corrections for these data are small and already applied to data
given in Table 1 of McElhinny and Opdyke (1964). The description from
that paper is as follows:

\begin{quote}
The Umkondo dolerites are not as widespread as the Mashonaland
dolerites, but they occur over nearly 3º of latitude, and it seems
likely that the ten sampling sites cover a sufficient time to average
out the effects of secular variation. The dolerites intrude the Umkondo
beds, which usually dip gently at about 5º in a southeasterly direction.
The directions of magnetization have therefore been corrected in each
case for the attitude of the adjacent sediments at each sampling site.
The corrections are very small; Fisher's k for the directions changes
from 57 to 58 on application of the corrections. This change is not
significant, but the corrections are so small that this is to be
expected. The directions cited for the various Umkondo dolerite sites in
Table 1 refer to the directions after correction for the attitude of the
sampling sites.
\end{quote}

    \subsection{Data from Gose et al.
(2006)}\label{data-from-gose-et-al.-2006}

    Next we add the remaining data first presented in Gose et al. (2006),
which includes a set of sites from northeastern South Africa.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  WD1 is from a unique cooling unit
\item
  WD8 is from a unique cooling unit
\item
  WD17 and WD18 are from the same sill. WD17 has better statistics and
  data from that sampling locality are used here.
\item
  WD19 is from a unique cooling unit
\item
  WD25 is from a unique cooling unit
\item
  WD26 is from a unique cooling unit
\item
  WD32 and WD33 may or may not be from the same sill given the complex
  geometry of the dolerites and overall poor exposure in the area. The
  sites have distinct directions and we are consider them to be distinct
  sills for the purpose of this compilation.
\item
  WD34 is from a unique cooling unit
\end{itemize}

We exclude NB2 given the interpretation of it as a Paleoproterozoic
cooling unit and TG05B given that it is associated with a baked-contact
test.

    \subsection{Data from Mare et al.
(2006)}\label{data-from-mare-et-al.-2006}

    Next we add data not included in Gose et al. (2006), reported in Mare et
al. (2006) from the Wilge River Formation dolerite. The sites sampled
overlap with intrusions reported in Seidel (2004) and Gose et al.
(2006), therefore only two new cooling unit means are used, WRD4 and
WRD5, two others being very scattered.

Another intrusion is sampled in Mare et al. (2006), the Swaershoek
Formation dolerite. However, data from this intrusion are not consistent
and sample level data are not supplied, making it difficult to
incorporate data from different sites into a correctly averaged mean.
Given the large differences between site mean directions, we exclude
these data from our analysis.

    We exclude sites that are redundant because there is no way to combine
the sample level data and because they are consistent with results from
Seidel (2004): 1. WRD1 comes from the same intrusion as W\_02 and W\_02
(Seidel, 2004) 2. WRD2 comes from the same intrusion as W\_04 (Seidel,
2004) 3. WRD3 and WRD8 come from the same intruson as W\_08 and W\_09
(Seidel, 2004)

Therefore we include sites WRD4, WRD5, WRD6, and WRD7, although the
latter two are likely to be excluded further in the analysis due to
thier high error interval.

    \subsection{Data from Wilson et al.
(1987)}\label{data-from-wilson-et-al.-1987}

    Next we add to the dataset additional data not included in Gose et al.
(2006), reported in Wilson et al. (1987) from northern Zimbabwe. The two
sites provided have a limited number of samples and poorly defined
sampling locality (with unknown ``Grid'' coordinates). The primary
reason that these intrusions are considered Umkondo-aged is because of
thier paleomagnetic directions. Also there are volcanics to the east
that are Umkondo in age, therefore it is very likely that the Umkondo
intrusive system extended across the Zimbabwe craton.

\section{Analysis of new paleomagnetic data from the Umkondo Large
Igneous
Province}\label{analysis-of-new-paleomagnetic-data-from-the-umkondo-large-igneous-province}

A field season to Botswana in 2012 resulted in the collection of
paleomagnetic samples from 32 mafic intrusions (some of them sampled in
multiple locations) with the goal of developing new data from the
Umkondo large igneous province (LIP). Paleomagnetic data for these
intrusions were developed at the Institute for Rock Magnetism and in the
new UC Berkeley paleomagnetism lab (as described within the main text).

\subsection{Analysis of demagnetization data from the newly samples
sites}\label{analysis-of-demagnetization-data-from-the-newly-samples-sites}

Samples from every site underwent alternating field (AF) demagnetization
at the Institute for Rock Magnetism. A subset of sampled localities (31
out of 40) were selected to undergo thermal demagnetization at the UC
Berkeley Paleomagnetism Lab. Six samples from each of these 31
localities underwent thermal demagnetization. For both the thermal and
AF demagnetizations, samples underwent a liquid nitrogen immersion in a
very low field environment after the natural remanent magnetization
(NRM) was measured with the goal of removing remanence associated with
multidomain magnetite which undergoes low-temperature demagnetization
when cycled through the isotropic point (\textasciitilde{}130 K) and the
Verwey transition (\textasciitilde{}120 K).

Principle component analysis was conducted using on the data using the
PmagPy software package as implemented in the demag\_gui.py program.

Below is the table with all tilt-correction parameters in dip direction
and dip with a short explanation of what orientation is being used. The
values are 0 if no tilt-correction was applied. Also shown is the
declination correction used for each individual site's bedding. This
correction was only used for bedding measurements, as sun compass data
were used for orienting paleomagnetic samples. Declination corrections
were calculated using IGRF11 and were determined using individual
locality coordinates.

\subsection{Data Reduction and Tabulation of Botswana
sites}\label{data-reduction-and-tabulation-of-botswana-sites}

What follows is a site by site analysis of the sample directions
determined through the least-square fits. When interpretable thermal and
AF demagnetization data were both developed from specimens of the same
sample, the thermal data are preferentially used.

\subsubsection{Kgale Peak Sill - PW1, PW2, JP1, JP2, JP3, and
J\_M9}\label{kgale-peak-sill---pw1-pw2-jp1-jp2-jp3-and-jux5fm9}

The behavior of JP1/2/3 (prior data) lacks consistency and these data
are unlike PW1, which was very well behaved. `Site 9' from Jones and
McElhinny (1966) is consistent with our results (S-seeking direction);
in contrast to the north-seeking direction reported by Pancake (2001).

\paragraph{PW1}\label{pw1}

All samples from PW1 are well-behaved and consistent.

These samples are from the upper chilled margin of the same Kgale Peak
sill as PW1. Only AF data were developed for this site. Four samples are
very consistent with each other with slightly steeper than results from
PW1.

\paragraph{JP(1,2,3)}\label{jp123}

Both PW1 and PW2 are from the same intrusion as Pancake's JP1, JP2, and
JP3 data. Only site JP1 yielded stable results, a mean with an
\(\alpha_{95}\) of 19.1 and has a northerly declination. Our thermal and
AF results seem to be more stable and consistent, especially considering
Pancake's other sites from the same sill PW2 and PW3 did not yield
stable results. Notably, both our data and that from Jones and McElhinny
(1966) indicate a south-seeking direction for the sill.

All thermal and AF results share a consistent direction. Above has
thermal (blue) and AF (red) specimens. We replace the thermal sample
PW7-10(thermal) with PW7-10(AF). Thermal analysis don't include samples
PW7-11 and 12 - the AF specimens are included.

\paragraph{Combined Mean (PW9\_AF)}\label{combined-mean-pw9ux5faf}

AF results are far more consistent than the thermal analyses. Two
thermal samples, PW9-7 and PW9-8, agree roughly with their AF
conterparts. However, overall the AF demagnetization appears to have
been more effective in cleaning the samples and these data are favored
for the mean that is added to the compilation.

The PW12 AF data are scattered and are not used for the combined mean.

We also need to import the Pancake (2001) data for JP(15,16) so that it
can be combined with the data from PW11/12; These sites sampled the same
intrusion. We only import data from JP15 because JP16 yielded fairly
scattered results from an outcrop that is slightly difficult to
correlate.

\subsubsection{Mogatelwane 1 Sill -
PW14}\label{mogatelwane-1-sill---pw14}

Samples from PW14 were only AF demagnetized. Results appear to be
consistent, but with a direction far different from that which is
typical of the Umkondo LIP.

\subsubsection{Molepolole Prison Quarry Sill -
PW18,PW19}\label{molepolole-prison-quarry-sill---pw18pw19}

Some of these samples appear to carry a Karoo LIP direction that is
opposite polarity to the Karoo dike reported in Gose et al. (2006) and
significantly different from the Umkondo LIP magnetization direction.

Probably a Karoo direction. Due to complications that can be seen below,
this direction could be an overprint on an Umkondo-aged sill.

If we consider the PW18\_AF samples directions as Umkondo in origin,
then we would dismiss PW18\_thermal directions and add PW18\_AF to
PW19\_ALL. This creates a wide spread of directions with a mediocre
mean.

The PW18 data have similar directions to the Karoo paleomagnetic
direction. It may be that the Molepolole Prison Quarry Sill is an
Umkondo sill with a Karoo overprint. Due to the lack of consistency
within the intrusion it is not included in this compilation or the
``unknown intrusion'' table.

Very good agreement between PW21\_AF, PW22\_thermal, and PW22\_AF. We
combine results for a robust mean direction. The Pancake (2001) data
from the same intrusion (JP(22,23,24)) is added before calculating a
mean.

The grouping of three samples that are NW and steeply down could be an
overpitn. However, the 5 samples yielded AF results (see below) with
directions very similar to other Umkondo intrusions.

The AF data are much more consistent than the thermal results. AF
demagnetization appears to have been more effective in isolating the
characteristic remanence than thermal demagnetization. There is only one
sample with a thermal result that is in agreement with its AF result. We
choose to use the PW25\_AF mean for the Mosolotsane 6 Sill.

Thermal results are quite scattered. Results from four AF specimens (the
same samples were also analyzed thermally) share a consistent Umkondo
direction. Although the error of the mean in high, this site will be
included in the summary table. The high error on the mean means that it
will be filtered out when the grand mean pole is calculated.

\subsubsection{Shoshong Sill -
PW28,JP31,JP33,JP34,J\_M(1-6)}\label{shoshong-sill---pw28jp31jp33jp34jux5fm1-6}

All samples are consistent with each other and have great behavior.
`Sites 1 through 6' from Jones and McElhinney (1966) (i.e.~J\_M(1-6))
were sampled in the Shoshong Sill, but cannot be combined with our new
results and those of Pancake because we do not have the complete sample
level dataset. The mean we calculate from this sill is a combination of
our data and Pancake (2001) data.

There is good agreement between the thermal and AF results with the AF
results having higher precision. We utilize the AF demagnetization data
for the mean and also add the data from JP31, JP33, and JP34, which were
sampled from the same sill.

The data is rather scattered overall, however there is decent agreement
between five samples with an south-directed Umkondo direction. Thermal
results near this group are already represented by AF specimens. The
three thermal specimens that roughly plot N and up are close to results
from AF specimens of the same samples. The edited five sample AF mean
will be added to the summary table.

\paragraph{Marseilles Hill Sill -
PW39\_ALL}\label{marseilles-hill-sill---pw39ux5fall}

There is good agreement between AF and thermal demagnetization data. The
mean direction is far from Umkondo, leading us to believe that this sill
is not part of the Umkondo LIP.

Great sample behavior and consistency. However, based on the direction
this is likely not an Umkondo sill, but probably an older sill as
described in Gose et al. (2006).

\subsection{Low Temperature Magnetizations from New Umkondo
Sites}\label{low-temperature-magnetizations-from-new-umkondo-sites}

A summary of the low-temperature components found in specimens that had
more than one component. There is no real consistency between sites, but
some sites have an internally consistent low temperature overprint. Our
interpretation is that the low temperature components from the
intrusions in Botswana can be attributed to viscous remanent
magnetizations, with no paleomagnetic significance.

We will plot the Karoo LIP pole from Hargraves (1997) with the low
temperature magnetizations from our new Botswana sites to see if their
directions are similar.

\begin{quote}
Virtual geomagnetic poles have been derived from over 2000 samples from
691 sites in Karoo igneous rocks, ranging from basalts and dolerites
through rhyolites, and at localities spread from Namibia through the
central Karoo basin, Lesotho to the Lebombo. After appropriate analysis,
poles derived from Lesotho lavas, Karoo dolerite dykes and sills, Sabie
River basalts, Mashikiri and Letaba lavas, and Jozini rhyolites, when
averaged, yielded a palaeomagnetic (south) pole at: N = 6, latitude =
-69.2, longitude = 98.3, alpha = 3.3. (Hargraves, 1997)

There is little in the way of consistency in the low-temperature
overprints between the studied sites. Given the small tilt little
difference between the geographic and tilt corrected results for the
low-temperature overprints.

Maybe some of the overprints are associated with Karoo magmatism or
older overprinting events, but there there is little consistency across
the sites and there are few directions similar to the Karoo
(\textasciitilde{}180 Ma) magnetization mean. We note here that Seidel
(2004) conducted a positive baked-contact test for a Karoo dike into the
Timbavati gabbro (TG-01). This supports the fact that the Umkondo
magnetization is older than \textasciitilde{}180 Ma. In general, the
lack of consistency between the overprints suggests that their origin is
due to lightning strikes or other processes such as wildfires both of
which have significant impacts on the slowly evolving southern African
landscape.

\subsection{Unknown and Older Directions (from Gose et al. (2006) and
this
study)}\label{unknown-and-older-directions-from-gose-et-al.-2006-and-this-study}

Below is a table of intrusions that are likely a different age than
\textasciitilde{}1.1 Ga. This includes intrusions that are estimated to
be \textasciitilde{}1.9 Ga (according to baddeleyite dates in Gose et
al. (2006)): W03, JP9, WD28H, NB2, and JP11. If new paleomagnetic sites
have similar directions to these sites it is likely that they belong to
the older event.

Above are site mean directions from intrusions that are likely of
younger and older age than the Umkondo event. The Karoo magnetization is
similar to the steep SE and down mean from PW18, if this is indeed the
case then PW18 could be an Umkondo sill overprinted by the Karoo event.
Other magnetizations that are steep NW and down (along with the
antipodal SE and up site means) could be Paleoproterozoic in age. One of
the intrusions, WD28(H) is dated at 1871.9 $\pm$ 1.2 Ma.

In directional space, the north seeking and south seeking directions are
consistent with sharing a common mean. In VGP space they are not.
However, given that there are only 4 north-seeking directions, and that
the north-seeking directions are therefore unlikely to average out
secular variation, neither of these statistical tests comparing the two
polarities are not particularly robust. The populations could be
identical with the north-seeking polarity being poorly sampled. This
analysis will be interesting to revisit if future work develops data
from additional north-seeking sites within the LIP.

\subsubsection{Comparing VGPs between sills and
dikes}\label{comparing-vgps-between-sills-and-dikes}

All sites included in the compilation are sills with the exception of
M-O-J which is a lava flow and Wil-1, Wil-2 and Palapye-dike which are
dikes. Prompted by a reviewer's suggestion that there may be a
statistical difference between the directions recorded by dikes and
sills in the LIP these populations are considered in comparision to one
another below.

Results of Watson V test: 

Watson's V:           1.9
Critical value of V:  12.2
"Pass": Since V is less than Vcrit, the null hypothesis
that the two populations are drawn from distributions
that share a common mean direction can not be rejected.

M\&M1990 classification:

Angle between data set means: 6.0
Critical angle for M\&M1990:   15.3
The McFadden and McElhinny (1990) classification for
this test is: 'C'

The VGPs from the dikes (N=3) and the sills (N=47) pass the Watson test
for a common mean. However, given that there are only three VGPs from
dikes this test is not particularly robust.

\subsubsection{Data from the Ethiopian
Traps}\label{data-from-the-ethiopian-traps}

Tauxe et al., (2008) included a compilation of elongation data from
large igneous provinces (Deccan, Faroe, Kerguelen, and Yemen) and
reported the calculated values and bootstrapped confidence intervals.
Tauxe and Kodama (2009) added additional data from the Ethiopia Traps
and the North Shore Volcanic Group where the parameters were plotted,
but not tabulated. These data are reanalyzed here in order to plot them
on a compilation with the new Umkondo elongation estimate. We also
analyze the Kerguelen data and confirm that our method yields the same
estimate as that presented in Tauxe et al. (2008).

The North Shore Volcanic Group (NSVG) is comprised of two main limbs
with distinct stratigraphy and radiometric age control. The southwest
limb of the NSVG was particularly well-sampled by Tauxe and Kodama
(2009) and those sites can be bracketed with age control from the 40th
Ave icelandite (Davis and Green, 1997; 1098.4 ± 1.9 Ma) and the Palisade
rhyolite (Davis and Green, 1997; 1096.6 ± 1.7 Ma).

The bootstrap error bounds for elongation values are generally large and
this is the case for the new Umkondo data. Broadly speaking, the
elongation/inclination pair from the Umkondo compilation is within the
range of that predicted by the TK03GAD model, and it is also very much
within the bounds of the existing data from the the Yemen LIP. The
elongation direction should be mostly in the up-down plane for a dataset
with paleolatitude of \textasciitilde{} 0 degrees. To evalatuate the
elongation direction, we plot the Bingham mean and a95 ellipse for the
dataset in local coordinates.

From the plots above we can see that the major axis of the Bingham
\(\alpha\)\(_{95}\) ellipse, which indicates the direction with the
highest error interval, is mostly along the up-down axis. Tauxe et al.
(2008) stated that ``directions\ldots{}are elongate in the up-down plane
at the equator.'' As can be seen in the plot of the Bingham confidence
ellipse above, the elongation in the data set is mostly in the this
plane.

\subsection{Kalahari and Grunehogna (crustal province in
Antarctica)}\label{kalahari-and-grunehogna-crustal-province-in-antarctica}

An extension of the Kalahari craton occurs in the Grunehogna cratonic
fragment in East Antarctica, which was detached from the main part of
the craton during Gondwana breakup. Archean crust in the Grunehogna
region is overlain by the Proterozoic Ritscherflya Supergroup, which
contains basalt lavas at the top and is intruded by related dolerite
sills. Geochronological and paleomagnetic evidence indicates that these
mafic rocks are components of the Umkondo LIP (Groenewald et al., 1995;
Hanson et al., 2006; Jacobs et al., 2008). Paleomagnetic data of Peters
(1989) and Jones et al. (2003) when combined give a mean pole that
overlaps with the Gose et al. (2006) Umkondo pole given the Euler
rotation of Grunehogna to Kalahari of -9.67ºN, 328.77ºE, and 56.28ºCCW.
This fit/Euler was recalculated given insights into the Neoproterozoic
tectonics of Kalahari and Antarctica (Jacobs and Thomas, 2004), defined
in Evans (2009) as -5.3ºN, 324.5ºE, 58.6ºCCW. Comparing our revised
Umkondo pole with the Ritscherflya Supergroup using the Euler rotation
proposed by Evans (2009) results in overlapping mean poles for the
Umkondo and Ritscherflya poles (see the plot below which was made in
J.P. Cogne's Paleomac software).
